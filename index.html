        <p>I am a Graduate from <strong><a href="https://www.mga.edu/">Middle Georgia State 
            University</a></strong>. I have been through three degress, but 
            graduated in two. The three degrees I learned under were Aviation - Pilot Track,
            Cybersecurity, and Web Development. I believe I still have a lot to learn in the Computer
            Science field. I also strongly believe that having a traveling type of IT job would be a 
            position I would love because I really wanted to be a pilot at first. Doing a job I 
            have come to enjoy along with a passion to travel would be my greatest dream. 
            After graduating, I have kept learning to code through educational websites like 
            UDEMY so that my skills do not deteriorate while also learning new methods of 
            coding and staying up to date with the industry.
